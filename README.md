# Traffic-Detection

The project aims to develop a data science model for predicting traffic patterns in a specific urban area to ensure the convenient movement of vehicles and safety for people. 
The model will leverage historical and event data to forecast traffic congestion levels at different intersections throughout the day. 
The dataset contains records of traffic flow at different junctions on various dates, with information on the number of vehicles passing through each junction. 
This solves the purpose of analyzing traffic patterns at different junctions, detecting any anomalies, and identifying potential areas for improvement in trafficÂ management.
